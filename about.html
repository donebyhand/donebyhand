    <h2>All About Jellies</h2>
    <div class="about1">
    <p>Let's dive into the basics about jellyfish anatomy! The most commonly recognized feature on a jellyfish is its umbrella-shaped top. Since jellyfish are made of 95% water, the top part of their bodies has a very similar texture to gelatin. A jellyfish's light weight combined with the bell-shaped top allows them to both float and propel through ocean waters. Attached to these "umbrella" tops are the jellyfish's tentacles. The tentacles are composed of many special cells containing venom that are used to sting their prey and act as a form of self-defense. With that said, every jellyfish is venomous, but the range of how much venom they inject through a sting varies with the species.</p>

    <p>You may be wondering: what about a brain? or heart? Jellyfish are actually some of the only animals that do not have centralized organs. Despite the lack of organs, jellyfish thrive and survive through a single, centralized nervous system. Additionally, the digestive system of a jellyfish consists of only one single opening that is used for both consumption and waste deposit. With that said, they have a limited diet. Most jellyfish eat smaller organizms, like plankton and algae. However, bigger jellyfish may have a diet consisting of small fish, shrimp offsprings, or even other jellyfish.</p>

    <div class="about3">
    <p>Jellyfish come in various shapes, colors, and sizes all depending on how differenct species adapted to various marine environments. For instance, the classic "umbrella-shaped" top mentioned above is not the same shape for every jelly. Some species may have a cylinder top while others have a more cone-shaped top. Furthermore, when regarding sizing, jellyfish can range from one centimeter all the way up to <b>thirty meters </b>(now that's a big jelly). The coloring of a jellyfish varies as well. Some jellies have vibrant hues while others are transparent and camoflague themselves. Coloring on a jellyfish can even include bioluminescence, meaning their bodies can glow as a way to communicate or fight off predators.</p>
